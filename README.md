This project develops a set of robot interfaces and systems to assist physicians in diagnosing children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Through the involvement of robots, children interact with the robots, and the medical team can make part of the diagnosis by observing their interactions and reviewing data analyzed by AI technology that identifies ASD-related characteristics. This reduces the need for direct interaction from the medical team, thereby saving time and human resources, and alleviating the burden on physicians. The system interacts with children through the interface of the Zenbo robot and interactive processes, combined with related technologies and AI computing modules, to obtain the required objective diagnostic information, including facial expression characteristics, eye tracking characteristics, and children's physical characteristics, assisting physicians in clinical diagnosis.
